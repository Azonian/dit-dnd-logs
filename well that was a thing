It doesn't fall however but hovers, gently orbiting him as it does. With a whispered word and gesture, soft music begins to play as he casts his new fly spell.

He twirls and spins, moving in tune with the music, practicing this new dance that the spell enables.... But the smooth elegant movements begin to drain away as time passes, the music abruptly ending as Masks movements become more and more erratic until he loses concentration on his spell. He stumbles onto the ground until his arms lands against the nearest wall. He takes a deep frustrated breath, his head just leaning against the wall as he tries to focus... But fails. Instead his attention turns to something else... His hand shakily reaches out to grasp the compass hidden within his baggy clothing. He holds it up and just stares at it, his grip growing tighter and tighter as his other hand even shakier moves to open the clasp hiding the needle.
